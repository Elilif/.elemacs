(setq package-enable-at-startup nil)

;; Adjust garbage collection thresholds during startup, and thereafter
(let ((normal-gc-cons-threshold (* 20 1024 1024))

            (lambda () (setq gc-cons-threshold normal-gc-cons-threshold))))

;; Prioritize old byte-compiled source files over newer sources. It saves us a
;; little IO time to skip all the mtime checks on each lookup.
(setq load-prefer-newer nil)

;; Prevent unwanted runtime compilation for gccemacs (native-comp) users;
;; packages are compiled ahead-of-time when they are installed and site files
;; are compiled when gccemacs is installed.
(setq native-comp-deferred-compilation nil)

;; A second, case-insensitive pass over `auto-mode-alist' is time wasted and
;; indicates misconfiguration.
(setq auto-mode-case-fold nil)

;; Disable bidirectional text scanning for a modest performance boost. I've set
;; this to `nil' in the past, but the `bidi-display-reordering's docs say that
;; is an undefined state and suggest this to be just as good:
(setq-default bidi-display-reordering 'left-to-right
              bidi-paragraph-direction 'left-to-right)

;; Disabling the BPA makes redisplay faster, but might produce incorrect display
;; reordering of bidirectional text with embedded parentheses and other bracket
;; characters whose 'paired-bracket' Unicode property is non-nil.
(setq bidi-inhibit-bpa t)  ; Emacs 27 only

;; Reduce rendering/line scan work for Emacs by not rendering cursors or regions
;; in non-focused windows.
(setq-default cursor-in-non-selected-windows nil)

;; More performant rapid scrolling over unfontified regions. May cause brief
;; spells of inaccurate syntax highlighting right after scrolling, which should
;; quickly self-correct.

;; Resizing the Emacs frame can be a terribly expensive part of changing the
;; font. By inhibiting this, we halve startup times, particularly when we use
;; fonts that are larger than the system default (which would resize the frame).
(setq frame-inhibit-implied-resize t)

;; The GC introduces annoying pauses and stuttering into our Emacs experience,
;; so we use `gcmh' to stave off the GC while we're using Emacs, and provoke it
;; when it's idle. However, if the idle delay is too long, we run the risk of
;; runaway memory usage in busy sessions. If it's too low, then we may as well
;; not be using gcmh at all.
(setq gcmh-idle-delay 'auto  ; default is 15s
      gcmh-auto-idle-delay-factor 10
      gcmh-high-cons-threshold (* 16 1024 1024))  ; 16mb

;; Emacs "updates" its ui more often than it needs to, so slow it down slightly
(setq idle-update-delay 1.0)  ; default is 0.5

;; Font compacting can be terribly expensive, especially for rendering icon
;; fonts on Windows. Whether disabling it has a notable affect on Linux and Mac
;; hasn't been determined, but do it anyway, just in case. This increases memory
;; usage, however!
(setq inhibit-compacting-font-caches t)

;; PGTK builds only: this timeout adds latency to frame operations, like
;; `make-frame-invisible', which are frequently called without a guard because
;; it's inexpensive in non-PGTK builds. Lowering the timeout from the default
;; 0.1 should make childframes and packages that manipulate them (like `lsp-ui',
;; `company-box', and `posframe') feel much snappier. See emacs-lsp/lsp-ui#613.
(setq pgtk-wait-for-event-timeout 0.001)

;; Increase how much is read from processes in a single chunk (default is 4kb).
;; This is further increased elsewhere, where needed (like our LSP module).
(setq read-process-output-max (* 64 1024))  ; 64kb

;; Introduced in Emacs HEAD (b2f8c9f), this inhibits fontification while
;; receiving input, which should help a little with scrolling performance.
(setq redisplay-skip-fontification-on-input t)

;; Shave seconds off startup time by starting the scratch buffer in
;; `fundamental-mode', rather than, say, `org-mode' or `text-mode', which pull
;; in a ton of packages. `doom/open-scratch-buffer' provides a better scratch
;; buffer anyway.
(setq initial-major-mode 'fundamental-mode
      initial-scratch-message nil)
