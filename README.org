Elemacs is a personal Emacs config. It may not be the best Emacs configuration,
but it is definitely the most comfortable and efficient one for me to use. I
have made a lot of hacks to adapt Emacs to suit me, so please be sure to read
the README before trying my configuration.

It is compatible *ONLY with GNU Emacs 29 and above*.

This folder contains essential libraries, useful functions, macros, and some
settings.
1. [[https://github.com/Elilif/.elemacs/blob/devel/core/core-incremental-loading.el][core-incremental-loading.el]]
   
    The code in this file is mainly taken from [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/blob/e96624926/lisp/doom-start.el#L180][doomemacs]] .

    Load packages incrementally. Any large packages here may cause noticeable
    pauses, so it's recommended you break them up into sub-packages.
2. [[https://github.com/Elilif/.elemacs/blob/devel/core/core-setup.el][core-setup.el]]

    Elemacs use [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SetupEl][SetupEl]] as its configuration manager. The main reason for
    choosing it is its simplicity and extensibility. You can use
    ~emacs-lisp-macroexpand~ or ~pp-macroexpand-last-sexp~ to expand any =setup= config
    to get more information.

    This file defines some useful setup-local macros, such as =:iload= ,
   =:silence= , =:option*= .
4. [[https://github.com/Elilif/.elemacs/blob/devel/core/core-lib.el][core-lib.el]]
   
   ~core-lib.el~ provides utilities that will be used in all configuration, such
   as ~elemacs-completing-read~.
5. [[https://github.com/Elilif/.elemacs/blob/devel/core/core-better-default.el][core-better-defaults.el]]

   Just like its file name, this file includes modifications to many default
   settings in Emacs.
6. [[https://github.com/Elilif/.elemacs/blob/devel/core/core-benchmarking.el][core-benchmarking.el]]

   This is a simple benchmark of calls to Emacs require and load functions. It
   can be used to keep track of where time is being spent during Emacs startup
   in order to optimize startup times.
7. [[https://github.com/Elilif/.elemacs/blob/devel/core/core-ui.el][core-ui.el]]
   
   UI config.
** =/lisp= and =/lib=
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: lisp_and_lib

These two folders contain configurations of many third-party plugins.
